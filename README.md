# Flask-Web-Service-Build

## Building a Web Service with Flask to talk to News API "https://newsapi.org/" and Deploying it on Github/Render.

### API

The API used in this application is news API https://newsapi.org/docs/authentication

Sample API KEY for testing: 11faa92d11d849c6ab86f167601dda93

### Flask Web Service:

Flask application would ask the user to enter any keyword that he needs to search along with the API KEY.

Then the application interacts with the News API and renders title, description, author, image, and news url in a grid view for the user to see.

Further it facilitates the user to click on each url and navigate to the original news source if necessary.
